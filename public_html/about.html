                        This site itself serves as a small example of their programming abilities. The majority of the site is made with just vanilla HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript to showcase a strong foundation of fundamentals, but of course their development skills don't end there. On the home page you will find various projects serving as examples in Sam's ever-growing portfolio.
