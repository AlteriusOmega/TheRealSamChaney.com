                        Python app to check health of hundreds of devices in a snap

            <p>This Python app is designed to monitor the health of devices in a highway tolling system. It does this by using HTTP to query all toll points in the system and check the status of each device on each toll point. This includes a variety of devices such as lasers, RFID readers, loops, and CCTV cameras.
            </p>
            <p>The app uses custom pass-fail logic to determine which of these devices are functioning properly and which have errors or warnings. This information is then compiled into an Excel spreadsheet, which is organized with intuitive color formatting and multiple tabs.
            </p>
            <p>It is a valuable tool for ensuring the smooth operation of a highway tolling system. By regularly monitoring the health of all devices, it helps to identify and address any issues before they become major problems.
            </p>
